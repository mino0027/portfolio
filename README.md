# Read Me Interview
## "Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes."

During the process of creating the portfolio, one of the biggest challenges I faced was time constraints and indecisiveness. 

They played a role with eachother as I wanted to do so much more but at that same time - due to piling up projects - I had to chose between whats worth adding and whats worth adding but after the project is due and on my own time. As with a tight time constraint I could not waste time on content or added elements that would eat through time. There is still plenty I would like to added but as I said that will need to be added after the fact.

## "What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?"
The key things I learned during this process was working smarter - having an outlined blueprint for what I wanted to execute allowed me to breathe and better manage my challenges. An example would be getting working Navigation and IMG/SRCSET/SIZES for resposnive and optimized images were 2 key elements that I wanted complete and valid as soon as possible and done before mostly everything.

Having not only a wireframe for the website but having an outlined scheldue with devliverables helped reduce stress and allow for a better workflow. Essentially leading to just needing to add page related content and not fix any "issues" page by page, content by content was something that I will translate into my other work. 

Another thing I learned was the desire to add more frameworks like Bootstrap to my work, as it allows for a more creative design/ development experience. Seeing what I have created only makes me want to do more and make something better ASAP; not just rest on what I have. As I can already look at my portfolio and make a list of more use cases for BS or find more frameworks to allow for more creative uses.
